REPLACE
* For all *.key files and *passwords.txt files:
  Replace their contents with the contents from their stated stache entries

ENCRYPT
* Edit the encrypt.sh script and ensure that the PUBKEY is pointed properly
* Run the encrypt.sh script to encrypt all files in ./local-secrets/data

COPY
* Move encrypted files into appropriate location in the puppet tree
  In *most* cases the encrypted files will land in one of the following
    ./profile/files/SERVICE/secrets
    ./profile/files/SERVICE/keys
    ./profile/files/SERVICE/credentials

Updating the core files for your specific implementation:

If any of the following core files need to be updated:
  * bootstrap.sh
  * Vagrantfile
  * ./local-secrets/encrypt.sh
  * ./local-secrets/*.pub

Perform a separate checkout of this repo elsewhere and populate only
The DEV level keys and passwords, in case of accidental commit.

Proceed with updates to the core files.
